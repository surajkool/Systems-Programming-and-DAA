# N Queen Problem (solved using Brute Force mechanism)

## General and Recursive Solution

The file `recursive_n_queen.c` contains a generalised code for N Queens.
This code uses a recursive approach, instead, of multiple nested `for loops` as implemented in the other two files.

### To run solution for N Queens:

1. Compile the code : `gcc recursive_n_queen.c`
2. And run it: `./a.out`

## Brute Force Solution for 4 Queens

Solution for 4 Queens is saved in `solution_4.c`

### To run solution for 4 Queens:

1. Compile the code : `gcc solution_4.c`
2. And run it : `./a.out`

The correct number of Solutions for 4 Queens is 2.

## Brute Force Solution for 8 Queens

Solution for 8 Queens is saved in `solution_8.c`

### To run solution for 8 Queens:

1. Compile the code : `gcc solution_8.c`
2. And run it : `./a.out`
